Easy approach :
    1) Store next node in temp
    2) Copy data of next node to current node
    3) Change next pointer of ucrrent node to next pointer of next node
1->2->3->4->null
Delete : 2
temp = 3
copy 3 to curr node
1 -> 3 -> 3 -> 4 -> null
temp.next = None
1 -> 3 -> 4 -> null (actual 3 gone)

class Solution:
    def deleteNode(self, node):
        # 1
        temp = node.next  # given input node is not last node
        # 2
        node.val = temp.val
        # 3
        node.next = temp.next
        temp.next = None
        del (temp)  # good practice
