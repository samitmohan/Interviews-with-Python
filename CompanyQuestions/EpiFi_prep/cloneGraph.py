Deep Copy : new graph with same structure and same values

Hashmap and DFS.
HashMap (old : new)
    1-2
    | |
    3-4
Start at 1, create copy of 1. (original has 2 neighbours)
For 2 and 3 nodes -> need to create copy.

1 : 1 (old : new)

node 2. 1 -> 2
2 : 2 (old : new)
2 has two neighbours, 1 and 4
Try to create 1 but 1 already present in hashmap so add 2->1 edge (undirected : both ways)
Create node 4
4 : 4 (old : new)

So on... DFS.
