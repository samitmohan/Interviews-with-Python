# https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-earnings-from-taxi/
# Sort A, solve it like Knapsack dp.

# Approach 1: DP
# Time:  O(n)
# Space: O(n)

# Intuition:
# We want to loop from location = 1 to n and at each step check if this location is an end point or not .
# If it is an end point then we check all of its corresponding start points and get the maximum fare we can earn .
# In order to quickly check if this number is an end point or not maintain a hashmap where keys="end point" and the values="[start_point, tip]""
