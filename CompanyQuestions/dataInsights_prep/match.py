"""
Aditya is playing a game on the computer where in each round he is given 2 strings out of which one string contains '*' and '?' in it.
The task of aditya is to find out whether string contains '*' and '?' matches with the other string completely or not, there are some rules as follows to match the strings -:
  1) '?' matches any single character
  2) '*' Matches any sequence of characters (including empty sequence)

Identify if the two string matches or not using the above two conditions.

Note : Both the strings should match completely.

Example 1 -:
Input : str = "aaa", pattern = "*"
Output : Match
Explanation : '*' can match any sequence of characters.

Example 2 -:
Input : str = "abcd", pattern = "a?cc"
Output : Does not match
Explanation : '?' matches with 'b' but after that the characters are not matching.

Example 3 -:
Input : str = "abceb", p = "*a*b"
Output : Match
Explanation : The first '*' matches the empty sequence, while the second '*' matches the substring 'dce'

Input Explanation : First line is the string and second line is the pattern.

Sample Input (Example 1):
aaa
*

Sample Output (Example 1):
Match
