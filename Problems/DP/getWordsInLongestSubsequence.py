"""
already handled the first condition via greedy. Now, conditions (2) and (3) bring new constraints that make it more combinatorial â€” hence, DP or graph search comes into play.

Now we also care about word content and their differences -> so can't pick the next valid word.


dp[j] is the length of a valid sequence ending at j
Adding words[i] extends that sequence, so we consider dp[j] + 1
We compare it with dp[i] to potentially update the best chain ending at i
