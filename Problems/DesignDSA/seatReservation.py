# reserve : smallest numbered seat

# the reserve and unreserve calls will always be valid
# only need 1 minheap = track of unreserved seats
# reserve = pop from unreserve = reserved : logN
# unreserve = take seat and add to unreserve minheap : logN

# heapify : take array and convert to heap
# but no need to heapify arr since values are from 1 - n

#    1
#   / \
#  2   3
# already a min heap : no need to heapify
