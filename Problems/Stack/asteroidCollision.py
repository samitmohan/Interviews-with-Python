'''
O(N) time and space
only if a < 0 and stack[-1] > 0 : collision takes place.
  and if a + stack[-1] < 0 : then negative asteroid wins so stack.pop()
      elif a + stack[-1] > 0 : then positive asteroid wins : ignore a (don't add in the stack)
      else a == stack[-1] : both asteroids explore : a = 0 and stack.pop()
