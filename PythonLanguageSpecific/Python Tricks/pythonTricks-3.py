Regular expressions
import re [stands for regular expressions]

match, returns a matching string object. result.group() needs to be called for the result

search returns matching string result when result.group() is called,

findall returns a list of all matched strings,

split takes a regex which is used as a delimiter to split the string,

sub stands for substitute: ,

\d for any digit [single character]

\D for any non digit

\s for any white space

\S for any non white space

\w for any alpha numeric character

\W for any non alpha numeric character

\b space around words

\A start of the string

\Z end of the string

{} occurrence of the character

Special character

\ escape character used to escape

. any one character

^ beginning of a string

$ end of the string

[…] range of values

[^…] matches every character other than the range provided

() to pass regex

(R|S) to give two regex, match either of the two.
