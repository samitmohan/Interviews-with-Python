# In an infinite chess board with coordinates from -infinity to +infinity, you have a knight at square [0, 0].

# A knight has 8 possible moves it can make, as illustrated below. Each move is two squares in a cardinal direction, then one square in an orthogonal direction.

# Return the minimum number of steps needed to move the knight to the square [x, y].  It is guaranteed the answer exists.

# Input: x = 2, y = 1
# Output: 1
# Explanation: [0, 0] â†’ [2, 1]

# Simple BFS
"""
Knight has 8 possible moves, for each move check whether knight is still in chess board after moves
    Add next square to the queue if it is still in chess board
Once square [x, y] is reached : return steps to reach square.
