- The “git pull” command is utilized for getting the updated version of the Git remote repository and combining them into the local repository. Whereas, the “git rebase” command creates a new commit that combines the two branches and moves the local branch's commits on top of the remote branch.

- Git Pull vs Push
    - Pull
        - This command pulls new changes from the currently working branch located in the remote central repository.
    - Push
        - This command is also used for a similar purpose but it follows a two step process:
            1. Pulls all commits and changes from desired branch and stores them in a new branch of the local repository.
            current
            2. For changes to be reflected in the current / target branch, git fetch should be followed by git merge command.
