Wait and Notify
Assign a Condition object (lock ðŸ”’) to the producer.
In the producer's produce method, call acquire() on lock, do any producing work. Once the work is done, call notify() to
    notify the waiting thread and call release.
In the consumer thread's consume method, call acquire() on the lock of the producer object that is avaialble to the
    consumer object. And then call wait() with a timeout value passed.
Finally call release method() on the lock object in the consume.
