"""
If 2 special characters not present : regular string match
if "a." compare it to "aa" since "." can be any character.
    "a." and "ab" also matches. but "a.." and "aa" = False
"a*" means character present before it can be repeated 0 -> infinite times
    =  [" ", "a", "aa", "aaa" ....]

"ab" = ".*" = ["", ., .. and so on] {one of the dots can be a and b}

Start from empty string, two choices : * or . [decision tree]
2 decisions, repeating n times (input string) = 2^n

With cache : O(n * m) or n^2

    c    " "
2nd choice better, i is unchanged, j += 2 (no need for * because we will never repeat c as it doesn't match first string)
    (i, j + 2)

aab and c*a*b [right after j there is a star that means "a" can be repeated 0 / more times]
i         j

    c    " "
        /  \

       a
now a matches (j matches i), i += 1 and j remains same (as it can be repeated since * is the next char)
    (i + 1, j)

in the end
aab and c*a*b
  i         j
s[i] == p[j] = (i + 1, j + 1)
aab  and c*a*b
   i          j

if i out of bounds but j in bounds
    a and a*b* :: Technically it does match
but if j out of bounds but i in bounds : doesn't work : must return false

Both out of bounds : Pattern has matched : return True
