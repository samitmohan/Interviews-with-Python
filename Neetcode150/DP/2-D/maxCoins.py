Which number to pop first? Once you do : continue on that (backtrack) : T = n^n
[3, 1, 5, 8] sub problem?
Pop 5
[3, 1, 8]
2 sub-arrays [3, 1] and 8
For array size of n : there are at-most n^2 sub-arrays
[3, 1] and [8]
We can't look at it independently as we'll get 6 and 8 = 14
But it is actually [3,1,8] : 3 * 1 * 8 after popping 1 = 24.

Clever trick.
Reverse thinking : Instead of popping 5 first, pop it at the last
[5] and popped_elements = [3,1,8]
1,[5],1 : 5
Remaining amount [3,1] : pop = [3,1,5] :
 pop 1 = 3 * 1 * 5 and
 pop 3 = 1 * 3 * 5

Array hasn't changed but pop all elements except 5 before.
How to? We know there is an explicit 1 on L and R
    Similarly = 1, [3, 1], 5 # implicit values : 1 and 5 now
                     L  R


For every value we will check if we can pop it last to get optimum answer and store in cache
2D cache : DP = [L][R]

Time : O(n^3)
cache is a decorator that helps in reducing function execution for the same inputs using the memoization technique
