"""
Getting the middle from a sorted list : easy
Add elements in order : getMedian : O(1) but array : O(n) = to improve use heap
    2 subsets : [1,2,3,4] : [1,2] and [3,4] all elements in left <= all elements in right
Small heap and large heap : all elements in small heap <= all elements in large heap (size of them approx same)
Small heap : maxheap
Large heap : minheap
[1,2] [3,4]
To check maxheap from small heap : 2 and minheap from large heap gives 3 and 2 <=3 (max(small) <= max(large))
+ another reason : median : [1,2,3,4] = (maxvalue of minheap + minvalue of maxheap)/2 : 2 + 3 / 2 = 2.5
if len of one heap is greater than other by 1 : approx equal
len(A) > len(B) : odd number
    max from A [1,2,3] : 3 -> median :: [1,2,3] [3,4] = 3

By default the elements can go in any heap : small heap (if ppt failing -> remove max from small heap and add to
large heap) Similarly if len(B) >> len(A) : move min element from large heap and move to small heap MAKE SURE
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN BOTH HEAPS IS LESS OR EQUAL TO 1"""
