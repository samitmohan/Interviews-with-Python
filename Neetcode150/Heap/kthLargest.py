'''
4,5,8,2 : k = 3
while len(nums) > k: pop
4,5,8 : min value : kth largest : 3rd largest value : 8,5,4 = 4

add() : just push to heap and pop the latest element only if size overflow (4 elements but k = 3, need to pop)

1) convert to min heap
    2) keep popping until heap.size() == 3 (then the top element of heap is our answer)
3) insert new values into heap
    4) do the same (keep popping until new heap.size() = k (size))
5) Top element of pq = answer for that val.
