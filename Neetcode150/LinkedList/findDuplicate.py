Without modifying it : Linked List : O(N) Time and O(1) Space
# Memorize Solution
  Form a LL with nums given -> notice that numbers are from range [1,n] and will always point to their indices
   0 1 2 3 4
  [1,3,4,2,2]
1->0
3->1
4->2
3->2
2->4

From this we can tell the cycle is at 4->2 and 3->2 because they both point to same. Using Floyd we can figure this
out. (First iteration of fast and slow will give us the point 3) To get the duplicate number : run floyd again with
slow2 pointer at same speed as slow (the next cycle will give answer/duplicate point) [memorize]
