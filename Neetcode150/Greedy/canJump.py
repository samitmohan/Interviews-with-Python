Reverse order
[2,3,1,1,4] (start from end and see if you can reach first)

[2,3,1,1,4]
Start position : 2
Goal : to reach 4
from 1 -> 4 :: easy (given)
So shift goal to 1 now
[2,3,1,1] : 1 (i) can reach 1 (goal)
Shift again : goal = 1
[2,3,1]
3 can reach new goal (1) easily
Shift goal : 3
2 can make a jump of 1 to get to 3 (goal)
