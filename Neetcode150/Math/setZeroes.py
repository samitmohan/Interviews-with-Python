# https://leetcode.com/problems/set-matrix-zeroes/
'''
O(1) memory.
Put the extra row and column array (_) and put it in the matrix.
Just one extra block
_ 1,0,1
  1,0,1
  0,1,1

0 spotted at [0][1]: mark 0 as 0 (column needs to be zeroed out) and _ as 0 (row needs to be zeroed out)

0 1,0,1
  1,0,1   (set 0 to 0 for column (already zeroed from before) and set [1][0] to also 0 indicating row is zeroed out
  0,1,1

In the end : 
  0,0,0
  0,0,0
  0,0,0

Trick to O(1) : use extra space : col0 :: initially false and if found (matrix[i][0] == 0) = set to true
